Proud of completing my most complex solo project thus far!!

In this one the focus was on functionality:
- started applying some naming conventions for the variables
- learned a lot about UX, input fields, labels
- I separated conscerns in different files to make my code more readable
- got to pull data from a JSON object, add/remove classes with JS to modify doc. style
- worked with various in-build array methods
- injected HTML with JS, created reusable functions

So excited to learn more about functionality!
