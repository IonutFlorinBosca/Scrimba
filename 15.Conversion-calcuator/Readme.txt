Who knew that 1.8 meters is 5.9 feet!
Main challenge on this one was to trigger all the conversions
at the same time...thus I created the functions and then 
created a unique function which calls all the functions in it's body!
Functions are really powerfull!
Worked also a bit with decimals, template literals/template strings!
