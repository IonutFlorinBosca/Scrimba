Who knew cats could be moody, confused, dominant!?
Wow, what a project!!!
This surely made me feel like I took my knowledge up a notch...
I'm talking for of loops, separating of conscerns, 
radio/checkbox inputs...also learned about the power of querySelector, 
new syntax with the checked attribute!!
Also grabbing modifying HTML not only with the ID selector but also
with the ClassName, adding and removing classes was amazing! How cool
is JavaScript!!!!!!!!
Not to mention filtering down options and mutating arrays with the
filter and includes method!!!
