And this concludes the basics for HTML and CSS!
In this project I selected a photo for the 'hero' section than created a palette of colours based on that photo.
I playied around with centering, either via the box model or flexbox.
Also imported a google fonts and added some basic pseudo-elements! Happy with the project!
