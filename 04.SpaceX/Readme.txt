Wow, what a nice project!
Learned new concepts in CSS like applying borders to text when the text color 
and the background color is similar are the text is hard to read.
Did that using text-shadow; also imported google fonts as well as other fonts.
In addition to that started using gifs on the web...how cool is that?
