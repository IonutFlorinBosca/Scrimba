Soooo happy with my latest solo project!
After learning about the powers of grid in css I started this project
and implemented a new concept plus some functionality with JS!
It's amazing when everything comes together and it works!!!!!
Stoked to learn about some more advanced JavaScript next and to
apply what I've learned in my future projects!!!
