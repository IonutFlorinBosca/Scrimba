I also separated conscerns in different files to make my code more readable and got to pull data from a <strong>JSON object</strong>, add/remove classes with JS to modify doc. style! Lastly, I worked with various in-build <strong>array methods</strong>; I injected <strong>HTML with JS, created reusable functions</strong>. So excited to learn more about functionality!",
