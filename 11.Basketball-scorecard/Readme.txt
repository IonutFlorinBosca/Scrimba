Slam-dunk or a missed shot?
On my second attempt of screwing together a project with
HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT I got some things done.
I start feeling much better working with containers in CSS.
Got pretty frustrated with the javascript.
My goal was to make my project run and also understand it.
After watching some youtube videos about counters and some
documentation on W3C schools I feel comfortable with what is 
on my file.
